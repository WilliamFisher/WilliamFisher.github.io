    <description><![CDATA[Introduction What Lies Below was a project I worked on for a game development class. It is written entirely in C# and is created with the help of the Unity3D game engine.
This project strictly followed SOLID design principles to ensure clean code that was easy to maintain and extend as the project grew. This project grew rapidly as I added new features to the game over about two months. In total I created over 50 C# classes to support a wide range of game systems.]]></description>
